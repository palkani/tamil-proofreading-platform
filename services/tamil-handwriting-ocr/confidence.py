"""
confidence.py — per-word confidence & flagging (plan §4.5).

Two independent signals decide whether a word is trustworthy:
  1. AGREEMENT — the two transcription passes (A vs B) should read a clear word
     identically. Where they disagree, the model was guessing.
  2. VOCABULARY — a word the Tamil dictionary has never seen is often a misread.

A word flagged by either signal is surfaced for optional human review. The returned
`confidence_pct` is the share of words that passed both checks — an honest, if
rough, "how much of this can you trust" number.
